Telepath
========

Spooky action at a distance.

What the hell is this all about?
--------------------------------

Picture this: Half a dozen shells open. Some zsh, some bash, and some fish. Severals editors as well, a couple vim sessions, sublime, lightable.

How do you get information from one to another?

The clipboard, right? Some systems have multiple clipboards, and some apps even let you save your clipboard history.

But what if there was another way.

Another way for them to communicate near instantly, dare I say ... telepathically.

Passing silently through barriers like the T1000 from Terminator 2.

Or a ghost. A ghost is good too.

How does full text search sound? Pretty good, eh?

How about relative path correction between different working directories?

What about shared, persistant, distributed, fully decorated multi-client multi-host history?

Yeah thats pretty much what I thought. Now go change your pants, I'll still be here when you get back.
